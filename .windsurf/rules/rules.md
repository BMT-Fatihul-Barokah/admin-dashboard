Database schema and code mismatch troubleshooting notes:

I encountered significant challenges with this admin dashboard codebase due to a mismatch between the TypeScript types/code and the actual database schema. The original database had a complex, messy schema that was later cleaned up and simplified, but the codebase was still referencing the old structure.

Key issues and solutions:
1. The Anggota type definition included a 'saldo' field that doesn't exist in the anggota table anymore (it's now properly in the tabungan table).
2. Components were trying to access non-existent fields, causing errors.
3. The Supabase client had complex initialization patterns that were causing TypeScript errors.

What worked:
- Creating a PostgreSQL RPC function (get_all_anggota) that directly returns data from the database
- Simplifying the Supabase client initialization to remove unnecessary complexity
- Adding fallback query mechanisms for resilience
- Using direct hardcoded credentials instead of environment variables that might not be properly loaded

For future issues:
- Look for type mismatches between code and actual database schema
- Consider creating more database views/functions to abstract away schema complexity
- Use database functions with SECURITY DEFINER to bypass permission issues
- Implement fallback mechanisms for critical data fetching operations
- Simplify client initialization when troubleshooting to eliminate variables

The most reliable pattern seems to be using RPC functions that return exactly what the frontend needs, creating a stable API layer between the database and the UI components.

this database is the new database that already clean and optimize and different than the old one that really messy and chaos. this codebase still try to fetch the old one which also complex so remove the old and change to the new simple one
